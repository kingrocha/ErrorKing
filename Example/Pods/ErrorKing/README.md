Add the ability of displaying smart error alerts and empty state views on your ViewControllers just by inheriting the ErrorProne protocol. No setup needed - Error King uses Method Swizzling to do the setup for you.

ErrorProne adds the errorKing variable to your ViewController. By calling it's setError() method, ErrorKing will store the error data and display an AlertView the next time your ViewController is visible - and an EmptyState view that does whatever you want after the reload button is touched.

```swift
self.errorKing?.setError(title: "Damn!", description: "Sorry for that.", emptyStateText: "Something happened :(")
```

The next time the ViewController is visible (if the user triggered a load but pushed another screen, for example), the user will be greeted with:

# Instructions
To add ErrorKing to your ViewController, add the ErrorProne protocol:

```swift
extension MyViewController: ErrorProne {
}
```

That's it! You can now call the errorKing?.setError() method and see it's effects.

To program what happens when the Empty State's reload button is touched, add this protocol method to your extension:

```swift
extension MyViewController: ErrorProne {
func errorKingEmptyStateReloadButtonTouched() {
//load my stuff again
errorKing?.errorKingEmptyStateReloadButtonTouched()
}
}
```

Additionally, you can further customize ErrorKing by telling what happens before the empty state screen is displayed:

```swift
func actionBeforeDisplayingErrorKingEmptyState() {
//do something before displaying the empty state screen, like disabling your tableView's scrolling
errorKing?.actionBeforeDisplayingErrorKingEmptyState()
}
```

Also, by changing the Empty state view's frame:

```swift
self.errorKing?.setEmptyStateFrame(rect: aFrame)
```

## Providing your own EmptyState screen

To add your own Empty State view, simply make a .xib that has ErrorKingEmptyStateView as it's class or superclass, link the corresponding outlets and then call

```swift
self.errorKing?.setEmptyStateView(toView: myCustomEmptyState)
```

You can see it in action on the Example project.
